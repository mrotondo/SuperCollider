    This is Sced, a SuperCollider interaction plugin for gedit.

    Sced aims to simplify SuperCollider experience on Linux systems
    as far as possible.

Installation
============

To install sced via cmake, configure the build directory with
`cmake -DSC_ED=yes'

Usage
=====

The menu items describe themselves. You're going to use the Ctrl+E shortcut
a lot. By default, this command evaluates the current line of code. If you
select several lines, hitting Ctrl+E will evaluate them all.

You can also select and run a ()-block. Just place the cursor on the opening
bracket and press Ctrl+E, i. e.:

( // press Ctrl+E here
"hello".postln;
"world".postln;
);
