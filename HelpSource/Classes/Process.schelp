summary:: Runtime environment for the virtual machine and interpreter.

description::
A Process is the runtime environment for the virtual machine and interpreter.
It has a subclass named link::Classes/Main:: which is where you should override the methods
of Process. There are two methods of interest. One is named code::startup:: and is
called after the class library has been compiled. The other is named code::run:: and
is called when the user chooses the Run menu command.

classMethods::

method::tailCallOptimize
Get or set tail call optimization. The default is on. Setting this to code::false:: can help with debugging by including intermediate levels in an error backtrace.

instanceMethods::

method::startup

called after the class library has been compiled. Override this in class link::Classes/Main:: to do whatever you want.

method::run

called when the user chooses the Run menu command. Override this in class link::Classes/Main:: to do whatever you want.
