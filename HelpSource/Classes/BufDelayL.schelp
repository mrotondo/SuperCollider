categories::  UGens>Delays>Buffer


Description::

Simple delay line with linear interpolation which uses a buffer for its
internal memory. See also  link::Classes/BufDelayN::  which uses no
interpolation, and  link::Classes/BufDelayC::  which uses cubic
interpolation. Cubic interpolation is more computationally expensive
than linear, but more accurate.


classmethods::

method::ar, kr

argument::buf
Buffer number.

argument::in
The input signal.

argument::delaytime
Delay time in seconds.

discussion::
Warning:: For reasons of efficiency, the effective buffer size is limited to the previous power of two. So, if 44100 samples are allocated, the maximum delay would be 32768 samples.
::

Examples::

code::

// allocate buffer
b = Buffer.alloc(s,44100,1);

(
// Dust randomly triggers Decay to create an exponential
// decay envelope for the WhiteNoise input source
{
z = Decay.ar(Dust.ar(1,0.5), 0.3, WhiteNoise.ar);
BufDelayL.ar(b.bufnum, z, 0.2, 1, z); // input is mixed with delay via the add input
}.play
)
