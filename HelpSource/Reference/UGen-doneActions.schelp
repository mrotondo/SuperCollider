A number of UGens implement doneActions. These allow one to optionally free or pause the enclosing synth and other related nodes when the UGen is finished. These include link::Classes/EnvGen::, link::Classes/Line::, link::Classes/XLine::, link::Classes/Linen::, link::Classes/DetectSilence::, link::Classes/PlayBuf::, link::Classes/Duty::, link::Classes/TDuty:: and link::Classes/Demand::.

For a list, see strong:: UGens>Synth control :: in the link::Browse#UGens>Synth control:: page.

section:: Actions
The available done actions are as follows:
table::
## 0 || do nothing when the UGen is finished
## 1 || pause the enclosing synth, but do not free it
## 2 || free the enclosing synth
## 3 || free both this synth and the preceding node
## 4 || free both this synth and the following node
## 5 || free this synth; if the preceding node is a group then do g_freeAll on it, else free it
## 6 || free this synth; if the following node is a group then do g_freeAll on it, else free it
## 7 || free this synth and all preceding nodes in this group
## 8 || free this synth and all following nodes in this group
## 9 || free this synth and pause the preceding node
## 10 || free this synth and pause the following node
## 11 || free this synth and if the preceding node is a group then do g_deepFree on it, else free it
## 12 || free this synth and if the following node is a group then do g_deepFree on it, else free it
## 13 || free this synth and all other nodes in this group (before and after)
